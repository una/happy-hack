# Happy Hack

The premise of this hackathon is simply to bring joy through code. Make something that makes your team or somebody else happy.

This project is a work in progress. I’m learning about web apps and node, and setting this up without any ruby dependancies.

I’m using Gulp for running tasks and Swig for templating. And Express. But I’m still trying to figure out what that is and such. Actually i’m still figuring all of this out :P

## Installation
